Compile with: javac -cp ".:junit-4.13.2.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar" *.java

Run tests with: java -cp ".:junit-4.13.2.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar" org.junit.runner.JUnitCore (..x..)
where (..x..) is the name of the class
E.G to run the test cases replace with 'GETClientTest' without the quotes:
java -cp ".:junit-4.13.2.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar" org.junit.runner.JUnitCore GETClientTest

Other test classes include:
AggregationServerThreadTest
ContentServerTest

Run non-test classes with: java (..y..)
where (..y..) is the name of the class
E.G to run the aggregation server, replace (..y..) with 'AggregationServer' without the quotes:
java AggregationServer

Run the GETClient with:
java GETClient *hostname:port* *id*

where *hostname:port* is the url, and id is the station id.

Run ContentServer with:
java ContentServer *hostname:port* *filename*

where *hostname:port* is url, filename is the name of the file to put onto the server

When running the tests, ensure that the aggregation server is running otherwise certain tests will
fail for the clients as they rely on the aggregation server.
